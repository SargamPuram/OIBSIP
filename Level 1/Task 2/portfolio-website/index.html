            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated computer science student with a passion for problem-solving and software development.</p>
            <p>👋 Hi there! I'm Sargam Puram, a passionate second-year Computer Engineering student .

                🎓 Currently pursuing my undergraduate degree, I've already dived headfirst into the world of web development and have a solid command over ReactJS, creating dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.
                
                🚀 My journey has just begun, and I'm excited to explore the fascinating realms of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the coming years. Interested to learn more about Rust programming language. With a growing curiosity for the potential these technologies hold, I'm determined to make my mark in this evolving landscape.
                
                🌟Beyond the digital realm, I'm also captivated by the world of DevOps, understanding the intricacies of streamlining development processes and ensuring smooth deployments.
                
                🌐 Passionate about open source, I actively engage with projects that promote collaboration and innovation. Embracing the ethos of open source, I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to contribute and learn from the global tech community.
                
                📚 During my free time, you'll find me lost in the pages of cosmology and space exploration books. The mysteries of the universe fuel my curiosity and inspire me to approach problem-solving with a broad perspective.
                
                🔗 Let's connect! Whether it's about tech trends, collaboration opportunities, or a chat about the cosmos, I'm always up for engaging conversations.</p>
